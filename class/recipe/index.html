<h2>How to Make Chewy Snickerdoodle Cookies</h2>
<h3>Follow these detailed steps to set yourself up with some flawless snickerdoodles. Happy baking!</h3>

<p>Prep for Baking: Preheat the oven to 400°F and line a cookie sheet with a silicone baking mat or a sheet of parchment paper.</p>
<p>
Combine Dry Ingredients: Combine the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Set the mixture aside.
</p>
<p>
Beat Butter & Sugar: Add the butter and 1 1/2 cups of the sugar to a large mixer bowl. Cream until the mixture is light in color and fluffy in texture, about 2-3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Add Eggs: Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until combined after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is incorporated.
</p>
<p>
Add Vanilla: Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
</p>
<p>Combine Dry & Wet Ingredients: Add the dry ingredient mixture to the combined wet ingredients and mix until combined.</p>
<p>Make Cinnamon Sugar: Combine the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar with the cinnamon in another small bowl.</p>
<p>Form Cookies & Add to Baking Sheet: Create balls containing one tablespoon of cookie dough each. Roll each ball of cookie dough into the cinnamon sugar mixture, then place them onto the prepared cookie sheet with about 2 inches of space in between each one.</p>
<p>Bake: Bake the cookies for 6-8 minutes.</p>
<p>Let Cool: Remove your cookies from the oven and allow them to rest for 2-3 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack.</p>
<h3>Enjoy! Serve your cookies while they’re still warm or wait until they’ve cooled to room temperature.</h3>
