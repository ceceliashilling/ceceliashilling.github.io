    <h1>Graduation rates for Hispanic students in MD <span style="color:#eb0027; text-decoration: underline;">14% lower</span> than state average.</h1></div></div>
    <h2>By Cece Shilling</h2>
   <p>National high school graduation rates have dropped since the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020. Maryland’s rate, however, has stayed relatively consistent. But one major ethnic group is much less likely to graduate than their white and Asian counterparts.</p>   
    <P>The national graduation rate in the U.S. was around 87% between 2018-2020. Maryland’s average was consistent with the national average, between about 86.75% and 87.12% in 2018-2020, according to the Maryland State Department of Education’s Report Card. The average for white students in Maryland in 2020 was about 94%, the average for black students was about 85% and the average for Hispanic students was about 72%.</P>

<P>In 2021 following the onset of COVID, students around the country were forced to complete school online from their laptops. During this period, Maryland’s average graduation rate remained at 87%.</P>
<P>Maryland Public Schools detailed the years following the pandemic and how they operated for the 2022 graduating class.</P>
<P>“2019-2020: Schools closed in March 2020 with students receiving limited virtual instruction for remainder of school year (10th grade) 
2020-2021: Schools in Maryland were virtual (11th grade)
2021-2022: Schools impacted by quarantine and absenteeism which is evident in the increase in chronic absenteeism across the state (12th grade),” listed Maryland Cohort Graduation and Dropout Rate documents.</P>

<p>In the 2022 school year, Hispanic students graduated at a rate 14% lower than the combined average for Maryland students. Asian students graduated at the highest rate, at about 97%, followed by white students. The national average graduation rate for Hispanic students is 81.7%, about 10% higher than Maryland’s Hispanic graduation rate, according to The United Health Foundation.</p>
<p>United Health ranks Maryland the third lowest state in terms of Hispanic graduation rates, only beating Minnesota and Louisiana. The list, based on data from the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics and the Common Core of Data ranks Texas the third highest and Alabama the second. The state with the highest rate of graduating Hispanic students is West Virginia, which borders Maryland.</p>

<p>A February press release by the MSDE noted high graduation rates despite COVID setbacks for Maryland students.</p>
<div class="pull-quote">
<p>“The graduation and dropout rates for student groups also remained largely constant from previous years, although gaps between student groups persist,” the release said. “Black/African American students saw improvement in the four-year graduation rate. Additionally, English Language Learners and students with disabilities both saw an improved four-year graduation rate and a decrease in the dropout rate since last year.”</p></div>
<p>The release did not mention changes in Hispanic graduation rates in 2022, which decreased 4% since 2021.</p>

<p>On a national scale, Hispanic students are now represented in higher numbers at four-year institutions, hitting a record enrollment rate in 2022, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>“Hispanic enrollment at four-year institutions, by contrast, continued to rise even during the first year of the pandemic, increasing by about 140,000 students, or 6%, from 2019 to 2020. Hispanic enrollment at such institutions has increased every year for decades,” said research assistant Lauren Mora for Pew.</p>
<p>Mora goes on to share data stating “Hispanics now make up one-in-five students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the U.S.” This statement is followed by a chart detailing the changing ethnic proportions of US postsecondary institutions from 1980 to 2020, in which Hispanic enrollment was initially 4%.</p>

<p>The University System of Maryland’s Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard does not break down racial or ethnic enrollment in-state public colleges but does include figures for “underrepresented minorities,” as one group.</p>
<p>The underrepresented minority groups include Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Native Hawaiian students. In 2020, this group represented about 37% of undergraduate students enrolled at Maryland public universities and 30% of graduate students. Representation has increased by about 2% in undergraduate programs and decreased by about 2% in graduate programs.</p>
