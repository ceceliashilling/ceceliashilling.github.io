    <h1>The Mandela Effect - Wikipedia</h1>
    <main>
   <p> <em><u>False memories</u></em> can sometimes be shared by multiple people. This phenomenon was dubbed the "Mandela effect" by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, who reported having vivid and detailed memories of news coverage of South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela dying in prison in the 1980s, despite Mandela actually dying in 2013 after serving as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. Broome reported that, since 2010, "perhaps thousands" of other people had written online about having the same memory of Mandela's death and she speculated that the phenomenon could be evidence of parallel realities.[13][14]</p>

   <p> One well-documented example of shared false memories comes from a 2010 study that examined people familiar with the clock at Bologna Centrale railway station, which was damaged in the Bologna massacre bombing in August 1980. In the study, 92% of respondents falsely remembered the clock had remained stopped since the bombing when, in fact, the clock was repaired shortly after the attack. Years later the clock was again stopped and set to the time of the bombing, in observance and commemoration of the bombing.[15]</p>

    <p>Other examples include memories of the title of the Berenstain Bears children's books being spelled "Berenstein",[16][17] the logo of clothing brand Fruit of the Loom featuring a cornucopia,[18] Darth Vader telling Luke Skywalker, "Luke, I am your father" in the climax of The Empire Strikes Back (he actually says, "No, I am your father" in response to Skywalker's assertion that Vader had killed his father),[19] Mr. Monopoly wearing a monocle,[20][21][22] and the existence of a 1990s movie titled Shazaam starring comedian Sinbad as a genie[23] (which Snopes suggests could be a confabulation of real memories, possibly including Sinbad wearing a genie-like costume during a TV marathon of Sinbad the Sailor movies in 1994,[24][25] the 1996 film Kazaam featuring a genie played by basketball star Shaquille O'Neal, and the 1960s animated genie-themed series Shazzan).[23][26][27] Likewise, false memories of Mandela's death could be explained as the subject confabulating him with Steve Biko, another prominent South African anti-apartheid activist who died in prison in 1977.[28][29][30]</p>
    
    <p>Scientists suggest that these are examples of false memories shaped by <em><u>similar cognitive factors affecting multiple people and families</u></em>,[17][31][32][33][34] such as social and cognitive reinforcement of incorrect memories[35][36] or false news reports and misleading photographs that influence the formation of memories based on them.</p>
